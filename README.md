# Thyroid Disease Detection

This repository contains code for exploring and predicting thyroid disease using a publicly available dataset from Kaggle: [Thyroid Sickness Determination Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bidemiayinde/thyroid-sickness-determination/data?select=dataset_thyroid_sick.csv).

## Features:

- **Data Preprocessing:**
  - Handle missing values and perform data cleaning.
  - Encode categorical variables.
  - Normalize/standardize numerical features.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
  - Visualize distributions of features and target variables.
  - Analyze correlations between different features.
  - Explore the relationship between features and the presence of thyroid disease.

- **Model Training and Evaluation:**
  - Implement various machine learning models such as XGBoost and AdaBoost.
  - Evaluate model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
  - Perform hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.

## Requirements:

- Python
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

## Getting Started:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/lizasizas/Thyroid-Disease-Detection.git
